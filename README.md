## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Having a `display: grid` to `place-items: center` is easy.

However, I tried to keep the card from the edges by setting its margin while having a `width: 100%` and `max-width: 24rem`. The margin didn't work.

So I ended up with setting padding on the parent container.

### Continued development

Trying to figure out the grid spec some more.
